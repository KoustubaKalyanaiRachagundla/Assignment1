<h1 > <font color="green"> The History of SUBWAY</font> </h1>
<hr>
<p>The Seventeen-Year-Old Entrepreneur 
Back in 1965, Fred DeLuca set out to fulfill his dream of becoming<br> 
a medical doctor. Searching for a way to help pay for his education, <br>
a family friend suggested he open a submarine sandwich shop.     </p>

<table>

	<td> <img src= "1stpic.jpg" alt=History, width=500, height=500>
	<p>It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop<br>
 to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1000, and a business relationship was <br>
 forged that would change the landscape of the fast food industry and the lives of thousands.<br><br><br>
The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, <br>
affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to <br>
grow over the decades but one thing remained the same and that was their core values and principles:<br><br><br>

   a) Always provide exceptional service to your valued guests;<br>
   b) Provide the highest quality menu items at a price everyone can afford and enjoy; and<br>
   c) Keep operating costs low and ensure you have great systems in place and never stop improving.<br><br>

These early principles continue to serve as the foundation for Subway restaurants around the world.</p><br>
